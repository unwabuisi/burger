# burger list


I love burgers! I created this web application to track down which burgers I'd tried at one of my favorite restaurants - Hopdoddys.  I also wanted to test my knowledge of Express and Handlebars working together with MySQL ([JawsDB](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/jawsdb)) in an MVC style architecture. 

This a full-stack web application that uses MySQL, NodeJS, Express and Handlebars.
